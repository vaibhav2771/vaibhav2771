Here's a single-line shell script that checks all folders present in /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/ and displays the names of those folders that do not have a symbolic link in /etc/init.d:
for d in /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/*/; do [[ ! -L /etc/init.d/"${d##*/}" ]] && echo "${d##*/}"; done

Explanation:
 * for d in /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/*/; do: This loop iterates through all directories within the /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/ path.
 * [[ ! -L /etc/init.d/"${d##*/}" ]]: This checks if a symbolic link exists in /etc/init.d/ with the same name as the current directory. "${d##*/}" extracts the directory name from the full path.
 * && echo "${d##*/}"; done: If the check in the previous step fails (i.e., no symbolic link is found), this part prints the directory name to the console.
How to use:
 * Open a terminal or command prompt.
 * Copy and paste the script into the terminal.
 * Press Enter to execute the script.
The script will then display the names of all folders in /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/ that do not have a corresponding symbolic link in /etc/init.d/.
Additional notes:
 * This script assumes that the directory names in /eClinicalWorks/prodapps/ do not contain any special characters that might interfere with the shell's interpretation.
 * If you need to handle special characters, you might need to modify the script accordingly.
 * This script is intended for educational purposes and should be used with caution in production environments. It is always recommended to test scripts thoroughly before running them on critical systems.
