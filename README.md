Here’s the modified one-liner script without using a loop and starting with [ -d ... as per your requirement:

[ -d /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc ] && [ ! -L /etc/init.d/tomcat_abc ] && echo "tomcat_abc"

Explanation:

[ -d /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc ]: Checks if the directory /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc exists.

[ ! -L /etc/init.d/tomcat_abc ]: Ensures that the symbolic link /etc/init.d/tomcat_abc does not exist.

echo "tomcat_abc": Prints the name tomcat_abc if both conditions are met.


Notes:

This script works for one specific Tomcat instance (tomcat_abc). If you want it to dynamically check multiple Tomcat instances, you would need a loop (which you've asked to avoid).

If this format suits your workflow, you will need to replicate or modify it for each Tomcat instance you want to check.

[ -d /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc ] && [ -f /etc/init.d/tomcat ] && [ ! -L /etc/init.d/tomcat ] && echo "tomcat"
This script does the following:

Checks for Tomcat directory:

[ -d /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc ]: This part checks if the directory /eclinicalworks/prodapps/tomcat_abc exists.
Checks for init.d script:

[ -f /etc/init.d/tomcat ]: This part checks if the file /etc/init.d/tomcat exists.
Checks if init.d is not a symbolic link:

[ ! -L /etc/init.d/tomcat ]: This part checks if /etc/init.d/tomcat is not a symbolic link. If it's a symbolic link, it usually means the service is properly linked.
Prints "tomcat" if all conditions are met:

&& echo "tomcat": If all the previous conditions are true (directory exists, init.d script exists, and it's not a symbolic link), this part prints the string "tomcat" to the console.
This script provides a concise way to check if the Tomcat folder exists, if the init.d script is present, and if the service is not properly linked.
